Discussed the rules about spans produced by collection literals, and whether those are 'safe to return' from the 'current method'.

Conclusion.  We will accept the rules in the provided link. Specifically, spans from collection literals are *not* "Safe to return from current method".
This has the benefit of allowing the compiler to potentially stackalloc these spans for very high efficiency code (including cases like `G([1, 2, 3])`).

While the compiler is free to use stackallocs for these spans, it is not required to do so.  However, as some consumers *may* only want to allow collection
literals when they will be stackalloc'ed we will ensure that the compiler emits a hidden-diagnostic if it heap allocs.  These consumers can set that diagnostic
to be an error, blocking unwanted span heap allocations.  In those cases, they can manually stackalloc.

Users who want to be able to return those spans can do so by explicit conversion to an array.  e.g. `Span<int> s = (int[])[1, 2, 3];`.
