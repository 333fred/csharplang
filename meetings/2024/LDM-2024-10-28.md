# C# Language Design Meeting for October 28th, 2024

## Agenda

- [Increment/decrement operators in conditional access](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/null-conditional-assignment.md#incrementdecrement-operators) (Rikki)
- [yield in try / catch](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/8414) (jared)

## Discussion

### Increment and Decrement Operators in null conditional access

An issue came up during implementation of null conditional access, which allows null conditionals as the target of an assignment.

The question is whether to allow prefix/postfix increment/decrement operators, and the proposal is not to allow them. The alternative when increment or decrement is needed is to use compound assignments. Technically, the prefix operators would be difficult, and the outcome may not be what the programmer anticipated. Doing postfix, but not prefix operators may seem odd.

#### Conclusion

We decided to disallow these operators. If folks find scenarios where they need these operators, we might revisit this decision in the future.

### `yield` in `try` / `catch`

The proposal is to allow `yield` inside `try`/`catch` blocks in iterators, which is a longstanding user request. There are challenges, both technically and in matching programmer expectations. These particularly arise during `dispose`. The proposal is for only `finally` blocks, and not `catch` blocks to execute during dispose, even when an error is thrown in the `finally` block.

We went through the details of the behavior, and there are concerns that the programmer may expect `catch` to be executed during dispose. We also discussed the behavior of `yield` during dispose.

No conclusion was reached. We'll reconsider this in a future meeting after offline work and discussions.
