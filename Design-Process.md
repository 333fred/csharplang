# Language Design Process

The language design process is the steps that a proposal takes throughout its life, going from an initial seed of an idea, to a championed proposal that is being considered
for inclusion in the language, all the way to the final specification representing a feature that has been shipped as part of a .NET release. It is very important to the
language design team that we have a clear process and organization for this, for multiple reasons:

* Our community is very active and vocal on this repo, and we want to make sure that feedback can be heard and impact the design and direction of the language, as well as
  ensuring that the community can follow the state of designs.
* We want to make sure that we are using our design energy effectively, and that we can see the status of previous meetings as we drive a feature to completion.
* We want to be able to look back historically to use previous design decisions to inform new language features, as well as to ensure that when a feature is incorporated into
  the ECMA spec, it captures the full nuances of what was designed.
